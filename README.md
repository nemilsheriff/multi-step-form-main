## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile first CSS design
- Add Javascript elements
- Mostly CSS flexbox
- Desktop version with CSS tweaks
- Made using pure Javascript / HTML / CSS

### What I learned

- Helped me reinforce how to use Javascript to control UI / form elements
- Reinforce learning related to CSS positioning and CSS media rules

### Continued development

Wondering whether to do the same project in React. I imagine it must be easier to do this in React using React Router.
